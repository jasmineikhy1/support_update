      How we protect your information

    %p
      We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against
      unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password,
      transaction information and data stored on our Website.

    %p
      Sensitive and private data exchange between the Website and its Users happens over a SSL secured communication
      channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.

    %p
      However, please note that data that is transported over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be
      accessible to anybody. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such
      open networks. When disclosing any personal information via an open network, you should remain mindful of the fact
      that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your
      consent. In particular, while individual data packets are often encrypted, the names of the sender and recipient are
      not. A third party may therefore be able to trace an existing bank account or relationship or one that is
      subsequently created. Even if both the sender and recipient are located in the same country data may also be
      transmitted via such networks to other countries regularly and without controls, including to countries that do not
      afford the same level of data protection as your country of domicile.

    %p
      Your data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorized parties. We do not accept any liability
      for direct or indirect losses as regards the security of your Personal Information or data during its transfer via
      Internet. Please use other means of communication if you think this is necessary or prudent for security reasons.

      Sharing your personal information

    %p
      We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information
      regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes
      outlined above. In addition to the use of information described above, Lingoloop reserves the right to disclose
      information provided by Users (including Personal Information) as follows:

    %p
      Disclosure By Law. You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by
      law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1)
      comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure
      is required by applicable law); or (2) protect or defend Lingoloop’s, or a third party’s, rights or property.

    %p
      Disclosure to Third Party Service Providers. We may share your information with third party service providers to
      perform functions on our behalf. For example, outsourced customer care agents or technology assistants may need
      access to your information to perform services for you. Your information will be treated as private and confidential
      by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize.

    %p

      merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, Lingoloop reserves the right to sell or transfer User
